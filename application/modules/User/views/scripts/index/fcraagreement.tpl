<b>MANDATORY TERMS FOR EACH END USER (TURSS SUBSCRIBER) AGREEMENT</b>
<br>
<br>

<b>Service Agreement</b>
<br>
<br>
<p align="justify">
This is the service agreement to use TransUnion® SmartMove® (“Service Agreement”). Your acknowledgement and agreement to these terms, as well as the Terms and Conditions of the internet site you are accessing (“Site”), are required to access and/or use TransUnion SmartMove. You agree to be legally bound by these terms. This Service Agreement is made and entered into as by and between TransUnion Rental Screening Solutions, Inc. (“TURSS") and you/your company (“Subscriber”, “You” or “Property Owner”). In consideration of the promises and mutual covenants hereinafter set forth, TURSS and Subscriber hereto agree as follows:
</p>
<p align="justify">
Scope of Agreement. This Agreement applies to any of those information services which Subscriber may desire to receive from TURSS and which TURSS offers to Subscriber via this Site. Such information services shall herein be collectively referred to as "Services" and all information derived therefrom shall be
collectively referred to as "Services Information." Subscriber enters in this Agreement on behalf of itself and its affiliates under common ownership and control, all of which are referred to collectively as Subscriber.
</p>
<p align="justify">

Subscriber's business. Subscriber certifies that it is utilizing the Services solely for assisting with making a residential or storage leasing decision.
</p>
<b>Consumer Reporting Services.</b>
<br>
<br>
<p align="justify">
1.1	Consumer Report Information. TURSS makes certain consumer report information services from consumer reporting databases, including but not limited to consumer credit reports and criminal record reports (“Consumer Report Information”) available to its customers who have a permissible purpose for receiving such information in accordance with the Fair Credit Reporting Act (15 U.S.C. §1681 et seq.) including, without limitation, all amendments thereto ("FCRA"). For the purposes of this Agreement, the term “adverse action” shall have the same meaning as that term is defined in the FCRA.
</p>
<p align="justify">
1.2	FCRA Penalties. THE FCRA PROVIDES THAT ANY PERSON WHO KNOWINGLY AND WILLFULLY OBTAINS INFORMATION ON A CONSUMER FROM A CONSUMER REPORTING AGENCY UNDER FALSE PRETENSES SHALL BE FINED UNDER TITLE 18, OR IMPRISONED NOT MORE THAN TWO YEARS, OR BOTH.
</p>
<p align="justify">
1.3	Subscriber Certifications. Subscriber certifies that it shall request Consumer Report Information pursuant to the written authorization of the consumer who is the subject of the Consumer Report Information. Subscriber certifies that each such written authorization will expressly authorize Subscriber to obtain the Consumer Report Information, and will contain at a minimum the subject’s name, address, social security number (where available) and signature. Subscriber shall use such Consumer Report Information solely for Subscriber’s exclusive one-time use and pursuant to the consumer’s written authorization use
such information solely for assisting with making a residential or storage leasing decision, and for no other purpose, subject however, to the additional restrictions set forth herein. Moreover, if requested by TURSS, Subscriber agrees to, and shall, individually certify the permissible purpose for each Consumer Report Information it requests. Such individual certification shall be made by Subscriber pursuant to instructions provided from time to time to Subscriber by TURSS. Nothing in this certification, or elsewhere in this Agreement, is intended to allow Subscriber to purchase Consumer Report Information for the purpose of selling or giving the report, or information contained in or derived from it, to the subject of the report, or to any other third party, and Subscriber expressly agrees to refrain from such conduct.
</p>
<p align="justify">
1.4	Recommendations.  Using Applicant and/or Tenant information provided to TURSS by Subscriber ("Applicant/Tenant Information"), TURSS will obtain consumer reports relating to each Applicant and/or Tenant and TURSS will evaluate the consumer reports ("Applicant/Tenant Reviews"). Based on the results of the Applicant/Tenant Reviews, TURSS will provide to Subscriber a Recommendation with respect to the Applicant and/or Tenant, based on the initial thresholds established by TURSS. Such thresholds, delivery specifications and decision criteria, and any changes thereto, shall be supplied or confirmed by Subscriber in writing. As part of the Recommendation service, TURSS shall also provide to Subscriber a sample letter containing information as to why the Applicant and/or Tenant was or was not approved. It is Subscriber’s obligation, however, to ensure compliance with any legal obligations when providing any information to an Applicant and/or Tenant.
</p>
<p align="justify">
1.4.2	All Rental Decisions to be made by Subscriber. Subscriber acknowledges and agrees that TURSS provides only Recommendations as to actions concerning an Applicant or a Tenant, and further acknowledges and agrees that all decisions of whether or not to rent property to a particular Applicant or

Tenant, as well as the length of and terms of any such rental, will be made by Subscriber. TURSS shall have no liability to Subscriber or to any Applicant, Tenant or other person or entity for any rental, or the failure to rent, to any Applicant or Tenant, or the terms of any such rental, regardless of whether or not Subscriber's decision was based on Recommendations, Consumer Report Information, public records, or other information provided to Subscriber by TURSS.
</p>
<p align="justify">


1.6	Compliance with Laws. Subscriber shall be responsible for compliance with all applicable federal (including, but not limited to the FCRA) and state laws, rules, regulations and judicial actions, as now or as may become effective, to which it is subject.
</p>
<p align="justify">

1.6.1	Subscriber certifies it shall comply with all requirements related to the public record information (“Public Record Information”) and other applicable data use restrictions (“Data Source Requirements”) described at rentalscreening.transunion.com/datasourcerequirements,  which may be altered by TURSS from time to time, and certifies that any distribution of the Public Record Information or a Consumer Report shall comply with and contain the state-specific requirements described at rentalscreening.transunion.com/datasourcerequirements, which may be altered by TURSS from time to time.
</p>
<p align="justify">
	
2	Ancillary Services
</p>
<p align="justify">
2.1	Fraud Prevention Services. TURSS offers several fraud prevention services that evaluate inquiry input elements against other input elements and/or against proprietary databases, to identify potential discrepancies and/or inaccuracies. Fraud prevention service messages may be delivered with Consumer Report Information as a convenience, but are not part of a consumer’s file nor are they intended to be consumer reports. In the event Subscriber obtains any fraud prevention services from TURSS in
conjunction with Consumer Report Information or as a standalone service, Subscriber shall not use the fraud prevention services, in whole or in part, as a factor in establishing an individual’s creditworthiness or
eligibility for credit or insurance, or employment, nor for any other purposes under the FCRA. Moreover, Subscriber shall not take any adverse action, which is based in whole or in part on the fraud prevention services, against any consumer. As a result of information obtained from the fraud prevention services, it is understood that Subscriber may choose to obtain additional information from one or more additional independent sources. Any action or decision as to any individual which is taken or made by Subscriber
based solely on such additional information obtained from such additional independent source(s) shall not
be deemed prohibited by this paragraph.
</p>
<p align="justify">
2.2	Scores. Subscriber may request, in writing, that TURSS provide Subscriber certain scores (e.g. scores received from credit reporting agencies (“Bureau Score”), SmartMove, Score, CreditRetrieverSM Score), in connection with the delivery of a consumer report obtained hereunder, collectively referred to herein as “Scores” for Subscriber’s exclusive use. TURSS agrees to perform such processing as reasonably practicable. Subscriber shall use Scores only in accordance with its permissible purpose under the FCRA and may store Scores solely for Subscriber’s own use in furtherance of Subscriber’s original purpose for obtaining the Scores. Subscriber shall not use the Scores for model development or model calibration and shall not reverse engineer the Scores.
</p>
<p align="justify">
2.2.1	Adverse Action Factors. Subscriber recognizes that factors other than the Scores may be considered in making a decision as to a consumer. Such other factors include, but are not limited to, the credit report, the individual account history, application information, and economic factors. TURSS may provide score reason codes to Subscriber, which are designed to indicate the principal factors that contributed to the Bureau Score, and may be disclosed to consumers as the reasons for taking adverse action, as required by the Equal Credit Opportunity Act ("ECOA") and its implementing Regulation (“Reg. B”). The Bureau Score itself, when accompanied by the corresponding reason codes, may also be disclosed to the consumer who is the subject of the Bureau Score. However, the Bureau Score itself may not be used as the reason for adverse action under Reg. B.
</p>
<p align="justify">
2.2.2	Confidentiality of Scores. The CreditRetrieverSM Score and the SmartMove Score are proprietary to TURSS and the BureauScore is proprietary to the credit reporting agency supplying the Bureau Score and, accordingly, without appropriate prior written consent, neither the CreditRetrieverSM Score, the SmartMove Score, or the Bureau Score may be sold, licensed, copied, reused, disclosed, reproduced, revealed or made accessible, in whole or in part, to any Person except: (a) as expressly permitted herein; (b) to those employees of Subscriber with a need to know and in the course of their employment; (c) to those third party processing agents of Subscriber who have executed an agreement that limits the use of the Scores by the third party only to the use permitted to Subscriber and contains the prohibitions set forth herein regarding model development, model calibration and reverse engineering; (d)
when accompanied by the corresponding reason codes, to the consumer who is the subject of the Score; or

(e) as required by law. Subscriber shall not, nor permit any third party to, publicly disseminate any results of the validations or other reports derived from the Scores without prior written consent.
</p>
<p align="justify">

2.2.3	Score Performance. Certain Scores are implemented with standard minimum exclusion criteria. TURSS shall not be liable to Subscriber for any claim, injury or damage suffered directly or indirectly by Subscriber as a result of any Subscriber requested changes to the exclusion criteria which result in normally excluded records being scored by such Scores. TURSS warrants that the scoring algorithms used in the computation of the scoring services, provided under this Agreement, ("Models") are empirically derived from credit data and are a demonstrably and statistically sound method of rank-ordering candidate records with respect to the purpose of the Scores when applied to the population for which they were developed, and that no scoring algorithm used by a Score uses a "prohibited basis" as that term is defined in ECOA and Reg. B promulgated thereunder. The Bureau Score may appear on a credit report for convenience only, but is not a part of the credit report nor does it add to the information in the report on which it is based.
</p>
<p align="justify">
2.3	Third Party Scores and Other Third Party Services. TURSS has the capability to offer scores derived from models built jointly with third parties, and other services provided by third parties, which are subject to additional warranties offered or terms imposed by such third parties. If desired by Subscriber, such third party scores and services shall be made available pursuant to separate agreement, which shall
be appended as a schedule to this Agreement.
</p>
<p align="justify">
2.4	Subscriber Forms. TURSS may offer the ability to electronically maintain and make available to Subscriber, at Subscriber’s request and direction, Subscriber’s forms including, but not limited
to, lease forms, lease addenda and consumer correspondence. Subscriber acknowledges and agrees that it is Subscriber’s obligation to ensure the accuracy and completeness of the forms and to ensure its
compliance with all applicable laws related to the use of such forms. TURSS makes no representations or warranties as to the content or use of such forms.

</p>
<p align="justify">
2.5	Subscriber Access. Subscriber agrees that TURSS may store data provided to Subscriber hereunder on behalf of Subscriber to be used by Subscriber solely for audit purposes and for no other purpose. All data stored on behalf of Subscriber by TURSS shall be owned by Subscriber and may not be modified in any manner.

</p>
<p align="justify">
3.	Additional Terms and Conditions.
</p>
<p align="justify">
3.1	Confidentiality. Subscriber shall hold all Services Information in confidence and shall not disclose the Services to any third party, except as required by law (i.e., an order of a court or data request from an administrative or governmental agency with competent jurisdiction) to be disclosed; provided however, that Subscriber shall provide TURSS ten (10) days prior written notice before the disclosure of such information pursuant to this Paragraph 5.1. However, this restriction shall not prohibit Subscriber from disclosing to the subject of the Consumer Report Information, who is the subject of an adverse action, the content of the Consumer Report Information as it relates to any such adverse action.
</p>
<p align="justify">
3.2	Web Site Access. TURSS will provide Subscriber with access to TURSS's web site (the "TURSS Site") so that Subscriber may, by accessing the TURSS Site, (i) initiate Applicant Reviews and Tenant Reviews and (ii) obtain or review TURSS's Recommendations to Subscriber. TURSS will assign one or more passwords and identification numbers ("Program Codes") to Subscriber for use in accessing the TURSS Site. Subscriber represents and warrants that it will use its best reasonable efforts to ensure that:
(1) only authorized Subscriber employees have access to the TURSS Site through Workstations; (2) TURSS Services obtained by Subscriber via the TURSS Site are not accessible by unauthorized parties via Subscriber's connection to the Internet or otherwise; (3) all Passwords are kept confidential and secure by such authorized Subscriber employees (e.g., Subscriber shall ensure that Passwords are not stored on any Workstation nor other storage and retrieval system and/or media and that Internet browser caching functionality is not used to store Passwords; (4) each User ID and Password is used solely by the authorized Subscriber employee to whom such User ID and Password was issued; and (5) all documentation and other materials provided by TURSS to Subscriber under this Agreement are held in confidence by Subscriber (and accessible only to those Subscriber employees who Subscriber has authorized to use the TURSS Site). Subscriber shall immediately notify TURSS if a Subscriber user with access to Program Codes no longer works for Subscriber and shall be fully responsible for any use of the TURSS site by users accessing the
site through the Program Codes assigned to the Subscriber. In the event of any compromise of security involving User Ids or Passwords, Subscriber shall immediately notify TURSS.
</p>

<p align="justify">
3.3	Safeguards. Each party shall implement, and shall take measures to maintain, reasonable and appropriate administrative, technical, and physical security safeguards ("Safeguards”) to (a) insure the security and confidentiality of non-public personal information; (b) protect against anticipated threats or hazards to the security or integrity of non-public personal information; and (c) protect against unauthorized

access or use of non-public personal information that could result in substantial harm or inconvenience to any consumer. When a consumer’s first name or first initial and last name in combination with a social security number, driver’s license or Identification Card Number, or account number, credit or debit card number, in combination with any required security code, access code, or password that would permit access to an individual’s financial account (“Personal Information”), is delivered to Subscriber unencrypted, Subscriber shall implement and maintain reasonable security procedures and practices appropriate to the nature of the information and to protect the Personal Information from unauthorized access, destruction,
use, modification, or disclosure. Subscriber shall notify TURSS in writing as soon as practicable but in no event later than forty-eight hours after which Subscriber becomes aware of any potential and/or actual misappropriation of, and/or any unauthorized disclosures of, any information provided to Subscriber by TURSS, including, but not limited to theft, loss or interception of Consumer Report Information, unauthorized use of TURSS subscriber codes and passwords, unauthorized entry to the facilities where TURSS data may have been accessible, or unauthorized release of or access to TURSS data by an employee or Agent of
Subscriber. Subscriber shall fully cooperate with TURSS in any communications to consumers regarding the
data incident and mitigating, to the extent practicable, any damages due to such misappropriation and/or unauthorized disclosure. Such cooperation shall include, but not necessarily be limited to, allowing TURSS to participate in the investigation of the cause and extent of such misappropriation and/or unauthorized disclosure. Such cooperation shall not relieve Subscriber of any liability it may have as a result of such a misappropriation and/or unauthorized disclosure. Moreover, without TURSS’s prior consent, Subscriber shall make no public notification, including but not limited to press releases or consumer notifications, of the potential or actual occurrence of such misappropriation and/or unauthorized disclosure of any such information provided to Subscriber.
</p>
<p align="justify">
3.4	Authorized Requests. Subscriber shall use the Services: (a) for its certified permissible purpose above to assist in making a residential or storage leasing decision; (b) solely for Subscriber’s exclusive one-time use; and (c) subject to the terms and conditions of this Agreement. Subscriber shall not request, obtain or use Services for any other purpose including, but not limited to, for the purpose of selling, leasing, renting or otherwise providing information obtained under this Agreement to any other party, whether alone, in conjunction with Subscriber’s own data, or otherwise in any service which is derived from the Services. Services shall be requested by, and disclosed by Subscriber to only Subscriber’s designated and authorized employees having a need to know and only to the extent necessary to enable Subscriber to use the Services in accordance with this Agreement. Subscriber shall ensure that such Subscriber designated and authorized employees shall not attempt to obtain any Services on themselves, associates, or any other person except in the exercise of their official duties.
</p>
<p align="justify">
3.5	Third Party Intermediaries. In the event Subscriber will utilize a third party intermediary (e.g., Internet service provider or other network provider) for the purpose of receiving Services, Subscriber shall first enter into an agreement with such third party under which such third party acts solely as a network conduit for the delivery of the Services to Subscriber and which prohibits such third party from using, or otherwise accessing, the Services for any other purpose. Subscriber shall be solely liable for any actions or omissions of such third parties which result in a breach of this Agreement.
</p>

<p align="justify">
3.6	Rights to Services. Subscriber shall not attempt, directly or indirectly, to reverse engineer, decompile, or disassemble Services or any confidential or proprietary criteria developed or used by TURSS relating to the Services provided under this Agreement. Except as explicitly set forth in this Agreement, the entire right, title and interest in and to the Services shall at all times vest exclusively in TURSS. TURSS reserves all rights not explicitly granted to Subscriber under this Agreement.
</p>

<p align="justify">
3.6.1	Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in the Agreement, TURSS hereby grants a limited, non-exclusive, non-transferable license to the Public Record Information, and the Services derived from the Public Record Information, from TURSS and that the material content of the Public Record Information and the Consumer Reports delivered by TURSS may not be altered, edited, or otherwise changed without the prior written consent from TURSS.
</p>
<p align="justify">
3.7	Fees and Payments. Though Subscriber has the option to request that the applicant/prospective tenant pay for the Services, the Subscriber is ultimately responsible to TURSS for the full payment of the Services. The fees associated with the Services are as stated on this website and are incorporated by reference. Upon delivery of the Services, Subscriber will be responsible for immediate payment, and outstanding amounts will be subject to a late charge of one and one-half percent (1.5%) per month (18% per year) or the maximum allowed by law, whichever is less. If collection efforts are required, Subscriber shall pay all costs of collection, including reasonable attorney’s fees. Any periodic and/or minimum Subscriber fees under this Agreement are non-refundable, in whole or in part, in the event of a termination of this Agreement. TURSS reserves the right to change the fees and charges from time to time, with such changes referenced on this website.
</p>

<p align="justify">
3.7.1	In addition, in the event that TURSS’s cost of rendering Services increases as a result of federal, state or local laws, ordinances or other regulatory, administrative or governmental acts, then TURSS may implement a surcharge subject to the following: (a) any surcharge will be applicable generally to TURSS’s customers; and (b) any surcharge will be applied only to services pertaining to consumers in the geographic area so affected. A legislative surcharge is imposed on certain types of reports pertaining to consumers residing in the United States, and an additional surcharge is imposed on certain reports
pertaining to only Colorado residents.
</p>
<p align="justify">
3.8	Term, Termination and Survival. The term of this Agreement shall commence upon the agreeing to the terms of this Agreement and shall remain in effect until terminated by any party hereto for any reason whatsoever.
</p>
<p align="justify">
3.8.1	With the exception of TURSS's obligation to provide Services under this Agreement, all provisions of this Agreement shall survive any such termination of this Agreement including, but not limited to, all restrictions on Subscriber's use of Services Information. Moreover, any such termination shall not relieve Subscriber of any fees or other payments due to TURSS through the date of any such termination nor affect any rights, duties or obligations of either party that accrue prior to the effective date of any such termination.

The first section of this summary sets forth the responsibilities imposed by the FCRA on all users of consumer reports.  The subsequent sections discuss the duties of users of reports that contain specific types of information, or that are used for certain purposes, and the legal consequences of violations. If you are a furnisher of information to a consumer reporting agency (“CRA”), you have additional obligations and will receive a separate notice from the CRA describing your duties as a furnisher.
</p>

<b>I.    Obligations of All Users of Consumer Reports</b><br><br>

<b>A.  Users Must Have a Permissible Purpose</b>
<p align="justify">
Congress has limited the use of consumer reports to protect consumers’ privacy.  All users must have a permissible purpose under the FCRA to obtain a consumer report.  Section 604 contains a list of the permissible purposes under the law. These are:
</p>
<p align="justify">
•    As ordered by a court or federal grand jury subpoena. Section 604(a)(1)
</p>
<p align="justify">
•    As instructed by the consumer in writing. Section 604(a)(2)
</p>
<p align="justify">
•   For the extension of credit as a result of an application from a consumer, or the review or collection of a consumer’s account. Section 604(a)(3)(A)
</p>
<p align="justify">
•   For employment purposes, including hiring and promotion decisions, where the consumer has given written permission. Section 604(a)(3)(B) and 604(b)
</p>
<p align="justify">
•	For  the  underwriting  of  insurance  as  a  result  of  an  application  from  a  consumer. Section 604(a)(3)(C)
</p>
<p align="justify">
•   When there is a legitimate business need, in connection with a business transaction that is initiated by the consumer. Section 604(a)(3)(F)(i)
</p>
<p align="justify">
•	To review a consumer’s account to determine whether the consumer continues to meet the terms of the account. Section 604(a)(3)(F)(ii)
</p>
<p align="justify">
•   To determine a consumer’s eligibility for a license or other benefit granted by a governmental instrumentality required  by  law  to  consider  an  applicant’s  financial  responsibility  or  status. Section
604(a)(3)(D)
</p>
<p align="justify">
•   For use by a potential investor or servicer, or current insurer, in a valuation or assessment of the  credit or  prepayment  risks  associated  with  an  existing  credit  obligation.    Section
604(a)(3)(E)
</p>
<p align="justify">
•	For   use   by   state   or   local   officials   in   connection  with   the   determination  of   child   support payments, or modifications and enforcement thereof. Sections 604(a)(4) and 604(a)(5).
</p>
<p align="justify">
In addition, creditors and insurers may obtain certain consumer report information for the purpose of making "prescreened" unsolicited offers of credit or insurance.  Section 604(c).  The particular obligations of users of "prescreened" information are described in Section VII below.
</p>

<b>B.  Users Must Provide Certifications</b>
<br>
<br>
<p align="justify">
Section 604(f) prohibits any person from obtaining a consumer report from a consumer reporting agency (“CRA”) unless the person has certified to the CRA the permissible purpose(s) for which the report is being obtained and certifies that the report will not be used for any other purpose.
</p>
<b>
C.  Users Must Notify Consumers When Adverse Actions Are Taken
</b>
<br>
<br>

<p align="justify">
The term “adverse action” is defined very broadly by Section 603.  “Adverse actions” include all business, credit, and employment actions affecting consumers that can be considered to have a negative impact as defined by Section 603(k) of the FCRA – such as denying or canceling credit or insurance, or denying employment or promotion.    No adverse action occurs in a credit transaction where the creditor makes a counteroffer that is accepted by the consumer.
</p>

<b>1.   Adverse Actions Based on Information Obtained From a CRA
</b>
<br>
<br>
<p align="justify">
If a user takes any type of adverse action as defined by the FCRA that is based at least in part on information contained in a consumer report, Section 615(a) requires the user to notify the consumer. The notification may be done in writing, orally, or by electronic means. It must include the following:
</p>
<p align="justify">
•       The name, address, and telephone number of the CRA (including a toll-free telephone number, if it is a nationwide CRA) that provided the report.
</p>
<p align="justify">
•	A statement that the CRA did not make the adverse decision and is not able to explain why the decision was made.
</p>
<p align="justify">
•	A  statement  setting  forth  the  consumer’s  right  to  obtain  a  free  disclosure  of  the consumer’s file from the CRA if the consumer makes a request within sixty (60) days.
</p>
<p align="justify">
•	A statement setting forth the consumer’s right to dispute directly with the CRA the accuracy or completeness of any information provided by the CRA.
</p>
<b>
2.   Adverse Actions Based on Information Obtained from Third Parties Who Are Not
Consumer Reporting Agencies
</b>
<br>
<br>
<p align="justify">
If a person denies (or increases the charge for) credit for personal, family, or household purposes based either wholly or partly upon information from a person other than a CRA, and the information is the type of consumer  information  covered  by  the  FCRA,  Section  615(b)(1)  requires  that  the  user  clearly  and accurately disclose to the consumer his or her right to be told  the  nature  of  the  information that  was relied  upon  if  the  consumer makes  a  written request within sixty (60) days of notification.    The user must provide the disclosure within a reasonable period of time following the consumer's written request.
</p>
<b>
3.   Adverse Actions Based on Information Obtained From Affiliates
</b>
<br>
<br>
<p align="justify">
If a person takes an adverse action involving insurance, employment, or a credit transaction initiated by the consumer, based on information of the type covered by the FCRA, and this information was obtained from an entity affiliated with the user of the information by common ownership or control, Section 615(b)(2) requires the user to notify the consumer of the adverse action.  The notice must inform the consumer that he or she may obtain a disclosure of  the  nature  of  the  information relied upon  by making a  written request within 60 days of receiving the adverse action notice.   If the consumer makes such a request, the user must disclose the nature of the information not later than 30 days after receiving the request. If consumer report information is shared among affiliates and then used for an adverse action, the user must make an adverse action disclosure set forth in I.C.1 above.
</p>

<b>D.  Users Have Obligations When Fraud and Active Duty Military Alerts are in Files
</b>
<br>
<br>

<p align="justify">
When a consumer has placed a fraud alert, including one relating to identity theft, or an active duty military alert with a nationwide consumer reporting agency as defined in Section 603(p) and resellers, Section
605A(h) imposes limitations on users of reports obtained from the consumer reporting agency in certain circumstances, including the establishment of a new credit plan and the  issuance of  additional credit cards.     For  initial  fraud  alerts  and  active  duty  alerts,  the  user must have reasonable policies and procedures in place to form a belief that the user knows the identity of the applicant or contact the consumer at a telephone number specified by the consumer; in the case of extended fraud alerts, the user must contact the consumer in accordance with the contact information provided in the consumer's alert.
</p>
<b>
E.   Users Have Obligations When Notified of an Address Discrepancy
</b>
<br>
<br>
<p align="justify">
Section 605(h) requires nationwide CRAs, as defined in Section 603(p), to notify users that request reports when the address for a consumer provided by the user in requesting the report is substantially different from  the  addresses in  the  consumer's file.    W hen  this  occurs, users  must comply with regulations specifying the procedures to be followed.          Federal regulations are available at www.consumerfinance.gov/learnmore.
</p>

<b>
F.   Users Have Obligations When Disposing of Records
</b>
<br>
<br>

<p align="justify">
Section 628 requires that all users of consumer report information have in place procedures to properly dispose  of  records  containing  this  information.    Federal  regulations  have  been  issued  that cover disposal.

</p>
<b>
II.   Creditors Must Make Additional Disclosures

</b>
<br>
<br>
<p align="justify">
If  a  person uses  a  consumer report in connection with  an  application for, or  a  grant, extension, or

provision of, credit to a consumer on material terms that are materially less favorable than the most favorable terms available to a substantial proportion of consumers from or through that person, based in whole or  in  part  on  a  consumer report, the  person must provide a  risk-based pricing notice to  the consumer in accordance with regulations prescribed by the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau.
</p>
<p align="justify">
Section 609(g) requires a disclosure by all persons that make or arrange loans secured by residential real property (one to four units) and that use credit scores. These persons must provide credit scores and other information about credit scores to applicants, including the disclosure set forth in Section
609(g)(1)(D) (”Notice to the Home Loan Applicant”).

III.  Obligations Of Users When Consumer Reports Are Obtained For Employment Purposes
</b>
<br>
<br>
<b>
A.  Employment Other Than in the Trucking Industry
</b>
<br>
<br>

<p align="justify">
If information from a CRA is used for employment purposes, the user has specific duties, which are set forth in Section 604(b) of the FCRA. The user must:
</p>

<p align="justify">
•   Make a clear and conspicuous written disclosure to the  consumer before the report is obtained, in a document that consists solely of the disclosure, that a consumer report may be obtained.
</p>

<p align="justify">
•   Obtain from the consumer prior written authorization.  Authorization to access reports during the term of employment may be obtained at the time of employment.
</p>

<p align="justify">
•   Certify to the CRA that the above steps have been followed, that the information being obtained will not be used in violation of any federal or state equal opportunity law or regulation, and that, if any adverse action is to be taken based on the consumer report, a copy of the report and a summary of the consumer’s rights will be provided to the consumer.
</p>

<p align="justify">
•   Before taking an adverse action, the user must provide a copy of the report to the consumer as well as the summary of the consumer’s rights.   (The user should receive this summary from the CRA.).   A Section 615(a) adverse action notice should be sent after the adverse action is taken.
</p>

<p align="justify">
An adverse action notice also is required in employment situations if credit information (other than transactions and experience data) obtained from an affiliate is used to deny employment. Section
615(b)(2).
</p>

<p align="justify">
The procedures for investigative consumer reports and employee misconduct investigations are set forth below.

</p>
<b>
B.  Employment in the Trucking Industry
</b>
<br>
<br>
<p align="justify">
Special rules apply for truck drivers where the only interaction between the consumer and the potential employer is by mail, telephone, or computer.  In this case, the consumer may provide consent orally or electronically, and an adverse action may be made orally, in writing, or electronically.  The consumer may obtain a copy of any report relied upon by the trucking company by contacting the company.
</p>
<b>
IV.  Obligations When Investigative Consumer Reports Are Used
</b>
<br>
<br>

<p align="justify">
Investigative consumer reports are a special type of consumer report in which information about a consumer’s  character,  general  reputation,  personal  characteristics,  and  mode  of  living  is  obtained through personal interviews by an entity or person that is a consumer reporting agency.  Consumers who are the subject of such reports are given special rights under the FCRA.  If a user intends to obtain an investigative consumer report, Section 606 requires the following:
</p>
<p align="justify">
•    The user must disclose to the consumer that an investigative consumer report may be obtained.
This must be done in a written disclosure that is mailed, or otherwise delivered, to the consumer at some time before or not later than three days after the date on which the report was first requested. The disclosure must include a statement informing the consumer of his or her right to request additional disclosures of  the  nature  and  scope  of  the  investigation as  described below, and  the  summary  of consumer rights  required  by  Section  609  of  the  FCRA.    (The  summary of consumer rights will be provided by the CRA that conducts the investigation.)
</p>
<p align="justify">
•   The user must certify to the CRA that the disclosures set forth above have been made and that the user will make the disclosure below.
</p>
<p align="justify">
•   Upon written request of a consumer made within a reasonable period of time after the disclosures required above, the user must make a complete disclosure of the nature and scope of the investigation. This must be made in a written statement that is mailed, or otherwise delivered, to the consumer no later than five days after the date on which the request was received from the consumer or the report was first requested, whichever is later in time.
</p>

<b>
V.   Special Procedures for Employee Investigations
</b>
<br>
<br>

<p align="justify">
Section 603(x) provides special procedures for investigations of suspected misconduct by an employee or for compliance with Federal, state or local laws and regulations or the rules of a self- regulatory organization, and compliance with written policies of the employer.  These investigations are  not  treated as  consumer reports  so  long  as  the  employer or  its  agent  complies  with  the procedures set forth in Section 603(x), and a summary describing the nature and scope of the inquiry is made to the employee if an adverse action is taken based on the investigation.
</p>
<b>
VI.  Obligations Of Users Of Medical Information
</b>
<br>
<br>
<p align="justify">
Section  604(g)  limits  the  use  of  medical  information  obtained  from  consumer  reporting  agencies (other  than  payment  information  that  appears  in  a  coded  form  that  does  not  identify  the  medical provider).    If  the  information is  to  be  used  for  an  insurance transaction, the  consumer must  give consent to the user of the report or the information must be coded.   If the report is to be used for employment  purposes  -  or  in  connection  with  a  credit  transaction  (except  as  provided  in  federal regulations) - the consumer must provide specific written consent and the medical information must be relevant.    Any user who receives medical information shall not disclose the information to any other person (except where necessary to carry out the purpose for which the information was disclosed, or as permitted by statute, regulation, or order).

</p>
<b>
VII. Obligations Of Users Of “Prescreened” Lists

</b>
<br>
<br>
<p align="justify">
The FCRA permits creditors and insurers to obtain limited consumer report information for use in connection with unsolicited offers of credit or insurance under certain circumstances. Section 603(l),
604(c), 604(e), and 615(d).   This practice is known as “prescreening” and typically involves obtaining from a CRA a list of consumers who meet certain pre-established criteria.   If any person intends to use prescreened lists, that person must (1) before the offer is made, establish the criteria that will be relied upon to make the offer and to grant credit or insurance, and (2) maintain such criteria on file for a three- year period beginning on the date on which the offer is made to each consumer.  In addition, any user must provide with each written solicitation a clear and conspicuous statement that:
</p>
<p align="justify">
•   Information contained in a consumer’s CRA file was used in connection with the transaction.
</p>

<p align="justify">
•   The consumer received the offer because he or she satisfied the criteria for credit worthiness or insurability used to screen for the offer.
</p>
<p align="justify">
•   Credit or insurance may not be extended if, after the consumer responds, it is determined that the consumer does  not  meet the  criteria used for  screening or  any applicable criteria bearing on credit worthiness or insurability, or the consumer does not furnish required collateral.
</p>
<p align="justify">
•   The  consumer may  prohibit  the  use  of  information  in  his  or  her  file  in  connection  with  future prescreened offers of credit or insurance by contacting the notification system established by the CRA that provided the report.     This statement  must include the address and the toll-free telephone number of the appropriate notification system.

In addition, once the CFPB has established the format, type size, and manner of the disclosure required by Section 615(d), with which users must comply. The relevant regulation is 12 CFR 1022.54.

<br>
<b>
A.  Disclosure and Certification Requirements

<b>NOTICE TO FURNISHERS OF INFORMATION: OBLIGATIONS OF FURNISHERS UNDER THE FCRA</b>

<br>
<br>

<b>All furnishers of consumer reports must comply with all applicable regulations. Information about applicable regulations currently in effect can be found at the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau’s website, <a href="www.consumerfinance.gov/learnmore">www.consumerfinance.gov/learnmore</a>.
</b>
<br>
<br>
<b>NOTICE TO FURNISHERS OF INFORMATION: OBLIGATIONS OF FURNISHERS UNDER THE FCRA</b>

<br>
<br>

<p align="justify">
The federal Fair Credit Reporting Act (“FCRA”), 15 U.S.C. 1681-1681y, imposes responsibilities on all persons who furnish information to consumer reporting agencies (“CRAs”).   These responsibilities are found in Section 623 of the FCRA, 15 U.S.C. 1681s-2.  State law may impose additional requirements on furnishers. All furnishers of information to CRAs should become familiar with the applicable laws and may want to consult with their counsel to ensure that they are in compliance.   The text of the FCRA is available at the website of the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau (“CFPB”): <a href="www.consumerfinance.gov/learnmore">www.consumerfinance.gov/learnmore</a>.  A list of the sections of the FCRA cross-referenced to the U.S. Code is at the end of this document.

Section 623 imposes the following duties upon furnishers:

</p>

<b>Accuracy Guidelines</b>
<br>
<br>
<p align="justify">
The FCRA requires furnishers to comply with federal regulations dealing with the accuracy of information provided to CRAs by furnishers.            Federal regulations and guidelines are available at <a href="www.consumerfinance.gov/learnmore">www.consumerfinance.gov/learnmore</a>. Section 623(e).

</p>

<b>General Prohibition on Reporting Inaccurate Information</b>
<br>
<br>

<p align="justify">
The FCRA prohibits information furnishers from providing information to a CRA that they know or have reasonable  cause  to  believe  is  inaccurate.    However,  the  furnisher  is  not  subject  to  this  general prohibition if it clearly and conspicuously specifies an address to which consumers may write to notify the furnisher that certain information is inaccurate. Section 623(a)(1)(A) and (a)(1)(C).

</p>
<b>Duty to Correct and Update Information</b>
<br>
<br>

<p align="justify">
If at any time a person who regularly and in the ordinary course of business furnishes information to one or more CRAs determines that the information provided is not complete or accurate, the furnisher must provide complete and accurate information to the CRA.   In addition, the furnisher must notify all CRAs that  received the  information of  any corrections, and  must  thereafter report  only  the  complete and accurate information. Section 623(a)(2).
</p>

</p>		
	
<b>Duties After Notice of Dispute from Consumer</b>
<br>
<br>	

<p align="justify">
If a consumer notifies a furnisher, at an address specified by the furnisher for such notices, that specific information is inaccurate, and the information is, in fact, inaccurate, the furnisher must thereafter report the correct information to CRAs. Section 623(a)(1)(B).
</p>
<p align="justify">
If a consumer notifies a furnisher that the consumer disputes the completeness or accuracy of any information reported by the furnisher, the furnisher may not subsequently report that information to a CRA without providing notice of the dispute. Section 623(a)(3).
</p>
<p align="justify">
Furnishers  must  comply  with  federal  regulations  that  identify  when  an  information  furnisher  must investigate a dispute made directly to the furnisher by a consumer.  Under these regulations, furnishers must complete an  investigation within 30  days  (or  45  days, if  the  consumer later  provides relevant additional information) unless the dispute is frivolous or irrelevant or comes from a "credit repair organization."    Section  623(a)(8).    Federal  regulations  are  available  at  www.consumerfinance.gov. Section 623(a)(8).
</p>	

<b>Duties After Notice of Dispute from Consumer Reporting Agency</b>
<br>
<br>

<p align="justify">
If a CRA notifies a furnisher that a consumer disputes the completeness or accuracy of information provided by the furnisher, the furnisher has a duty to follow certain procedures. The furnisher must:
</p>
<p align="justify">
•     Conduct   an   investigation   and   review   all   relevant   information   provided   by   the   CRA,   including information given to the CRA by the consumer. Section 623(b)(1)(A) and (b)(1)(B).
</p>
<p align="justify">
•     Report the  results to  the  CRA that  referred the  dispute, and,  if  the  investigation establishes that  the information was, in fact, incomplete or inaccurate, report the results to all CRAs to which the furnisher provided the information that compile and maintain files on a nationwide basis.  Section 623(b)(1)(C) and (b)(1)(D).
</p>
<p align="justify">
•     Complete the above steps within thirty (30) days from the date the CRA receives the dispute (or 45 days, if the consumer later provides relevant additional information to the CRA). Section 623(b)(2).
</p>
<p align="justify">
•    Promptly modify or delete the information, or block its reporting. Section 623(b)(1)(E).
</p>

<b>Duty to Report Voluntary Closing of Credit Accounts:</b>
<br>
<br>

<p align="justify">
If  a consumer voluntarily closes a credit account, any person who regularly and  in the  ordinary course of business furnished information to one or more CRAs must report this fact when it provides information to CRAs for the time period in which the account was closed. Section 623(a)(4).
</p>

<b>Duty to Report Dates of Delinquencies:</b>
<br>
<br>

<p align="justify">
If a furnisher reports information concerning a delinquent account placed for collection, charged to profit or loss, or subject to any similar action, the furnisher must, within 90 days after reporting the information, provide the CRA with the month and the year of the commencement of the delinquency that immediately preceded the action, so that the agency will know how long to keep the information in the consumer’s file. Section 623(a)(5)
</p>

<p align="justify">
Any  person,  such  as  a  debt  collector,  that  has  acquired  or  is  responsible  for  collecting  delinquent accounts and that reports information to CRAs may comply with the requirements of Section 623(a)(5) (until there is a consumer dispute) by reporting the same delinquency date previously reported by the creditor.   If the creditor did not report this date, they may comply with the FCRA by establishing reasonable procedures to obtain and report delinquency dates, or, if a delinquency date cannot be reasonably obtained, by following reasonable procedures to ensure that the date reported precedes the date when the account was placed for collection, charged to profit or loss, or subjected to any similar action. Section 623(a)(5).
</p>

<b>Duties of Financial Institutions When Reporting Negative Information</b>
<br>
<br>

<p align="justify">
Financial institutions that furnish information to "nationwide" consumer reporting agencies, as defined in Section
603(p),  must  notify  consumers  in  writing  if  they  may  furnish  or  have  furnished  negative information to a
CRA. Section 623(a)(7). The CFPB has prescribed model disclosures, 12 CFR Part 222, App.B.
</p>

<b>Duties When Furnishing Medical Information</b>
<br>
<br>

<p align="justify">
A furnisher whose primary business is providing medical services, products, or devices (and such furnisher's agents or assignees) is a medical information furnisher for the purposes of the FCRA and must notify all CRAs to which it reports of this fact.   Section 623(a)(9).   This notice will enable CRAs comply with their duties under Section 604(g) when reporting medical information.
</p>

<b>Duties When ID Theft Occurs</b>
<br>
<br>

<p align="justify">
All furnishers must have in place reasonable procedures to respond to notifications from CRAs that information furnished is the result of identity theft, and to prevent refurnishing the information in the future. A furnisher may not furnish information that a consumer has identified as resulting from identity theft unless the furnisher subsequently knows or is informed by the consumer that the information is correct. Section 623(a)(6).  If a furnisher learns that it has furnished inaccurate information due to identity theft, it must notify each CRA of the correct information and must thereafter report only complete and accurate information. Section 623(a)(2). W hen any furnisher of information is notified pursuant to the procedures set	forth in Section 605B that a debt has resulted from identity theft, the furnisher may not sell, transfer, or place for collection the debt except in certain limited circumstances. Section 615(f).
